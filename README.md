Things i have considered but not done.

1. Writing tests to test the "toPokemonData"
2. If you press a pokemon and then one again quick it will open 2 pokemons
3. Could have made some fast forward to an index instead of just having to drag to go to the bottom
4. Could have made a filter to filter on types
5. The colors and themes are not setup entirely correct but since this is a POC i did not invest time into that
6. It is mentioned when navigating in compose that you should not send the parcelable data to the other navigation, 
however i did that. I fetched all data at the start and when paging for efficiency later, since i need the photos.


I have tested accessibility and dark mode and it works

I have tried doing the calls async to speed it up

I wanted to invest more time in design and animation to make it more flashy but had not time for it.

It was a really fun task to do!
