Things i have considered but not done.

1. Writing tests to test the "toPokemonData"
2. If you press a pokemon and then one again quick it will open 2 pokemons
3. Could have made some fast forward to an index instead of just having to drag to go to the bottom
4. Could have made a filter to filter on types
5. The colors and themes are not setup entirely correct but since this is a POC i did not invest time into that


I have tested accessibility and dark mode and it works

It was a really fun task to do!
