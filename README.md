Things that is thought about.

The project uses MVVM with Hilt DI.

Tests are used to calculate the distance.

I did not figured out why i wanted to know the Length of vector. But if i would have worked with it
I would have discussed it.

Currently color picker details and color picker list is in the app feature. These could have been moved
out to a feature instead.

Since this is a MVP i have not included Any bottom navigation bar or similar since that might have confused the user if the other tabs was empty

Dark mode is supported

Rotation works

Accessibility is nearly working when the text is very big.


Good luck and have fun! :)

Fun fact, most of the time was spent setting up the project with imports, as you might know how tedious it can be some times. :)
